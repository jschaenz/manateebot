# Twitchbot made using NodeJS and TMI.js by manateeoverlord69.
This Bot is not designed for a mission critical implementation, it is just a fun side project for learning Javascript.

I, the owner of this code, am not responsible for any damage to person or property caused by this bot, use it at your own risk.

All API Keys have been hidden, if you want to use the bot replace them with your own in the config.js file.
Any questions are best answered in Twitch #nymn or #supinic where i am most often found.

The life expectancy calculator uses data provided by https://github.com/hemanth/life-expectancy .

The command cooldown was inspired by the implementation in KUNszgbot


Roadmap:
~march: get website up and running, make commands its own module file, generally restructure commands layout
